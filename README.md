# AGROBOOT
Objective: To develope a machine learning model to accurately identify and segment regions of plant leaves affected by diseases or pests from images.
Data Handling: Utilized a large dataset of plant leaf images, leveraging TensorFlow for preprocessing and augmentation to enhance model performance.
Model Architecture: Designed a deep learning model with multiple Conv2D layers, MaxPooling, and Dense layers, optimized with Adam optimizer and trained with Sparse Categorical Crossentropy loss.
Performance Metrics: Achieved high accuracy and low loss on both training and validation datasets, monitored through comprehensive accuracy and loss plots.
Data Augmentation: Implemented advanced data augmentation techniques, including random flips and rotations, to improve model robustness.
Evaluation: Evaluated the model using a separate test dataset, obtaining precise accuracy and loss metrics.
Prediction Capability: Developed a function for predicting the class and confidence of disease/pest in new images, ensuring practical applicability.
Model Deployment: Successfully saved and deployed the trained model for real-world usage.
Tools & Technologies: TensorFlow, Keras, Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, Google Colab.
